# instagib

## todo:

- still have yet to understand a few code segments...

- need a better crosshair
- add some more spawn points
- scoreboard
- killfeed
- test player disconnect, bug where host can't disconnect Before clients
- better lobby system with dedicated server: so only join button needed, sends player to existing lobby. When a sufficient nbr of players join, start countdown for game start (hypixel)
- settings page for sens and custom keybinds
- verify bandwidth usage (no clue how to, but apparently an issue)
- dash mechanic
- search up better player controllers
- client side shooting animations, maybe server side raycast trajectory (ink from the pen or smth...)
- sound effects, ingame track
- design a fun map, playtest tons

## endgame todo, if all done with previous:

- steamworks api, upload on steam. Works with p2p networks says gpt
- player customization
